CS-465-Full Stack Development with MEAN
1. Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full-stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
- The frontend development part of this project consists of a customer-facing website that is built upon Nodejs, Express HTML, and MongoDB technologies. There is also an admin-only access site that is built using single-page application (SPA) technology. The main programing language used to develop the customer-facing section of the web application was JavaScript in comparison to the TypeScript programing language for developing the admin-only single-page application access site.
2. Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
- MongoDB database is an excellent database tool for storing data as key/value pairs. MongoDB database is an essential tool to permanently and successfully store website data such as user information, travel packages, and other necessary data that the website uses for its operation.
